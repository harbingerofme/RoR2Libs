**(stripped) Libraries for building RoR2 plugins.**
I do not own any library included on this repository, and I provide them free-of-use and as-is. 
Several of these are licenced under MIT, which are not stripped. 
Others I do not know which license they fall under, in which case they are stripped.


What's included:

# Libraries:
## Stripped:
* `Risk of Rain 2_Data\Managed` 4478858 (Hidden Realms)
* [HJUpdaterAPI 1.4.1](https://thunderstore.io/package/Lodington/HjUpdaterAPI/1.4.1) 
* `NewtonSoft.Json`

## Unstripped
* [BepinexPack 3.0.0](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/3.0.0/) (as it appears on thunderstore)
* [R2API 2.3.22 (2.3.14 ingame)](https://thunderstore.io/package/tristanmcpherson/R2API/2.3.22/)
* [MiniRPCLib 0.01*](https://thunderstore.io/package/wildbook/MiniRpcLib/0.0.1) Modified to not interfere with R2API's Commandhelper. 

#Additionally
* cil-stripper script (by @mistername)
* `setup.bat` (clones this repo and cleans it up)
* `setup - noGit (slow).ps1` (clones this repo and cleans it up. Slower than the Batch script, but doesn't require git.)
