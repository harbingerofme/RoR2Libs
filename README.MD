# (stripped) Libraries for building RoR2 plugins

I do not own any library included on this repository, and I provide them free-of-use and as-is.
Several of these are licenced under MIT, which are not stripped.
Others I do not know which license they fall under, in which case they are stripped.

You may find a non-core pack under the "Additionals" branch.

## Libraries

### Stripped

* `Risk of Rain 2_Data\Managed` version 5440050 (Full Release, patch 1)

### Unstripped

* [BepinexPack 5.3.1](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/)

* [R2API 2.5.14](https://thunderstore.io/package/tristanmcpherson/R2API/)

### Additionally

* cil-stripper script (by @mistername)
* `setup.bat` (clones this repo and cleans it up)
* `setup - noGit (slow).ps1` (clones this repo and cleans it up. Slower than the Batch script, but doesn't require git.)
